The taxonomy was developed in four stages:

1. **Version 1:** Based on the original definitions of rule types.

2. **Version 2:** Informed by a systematic review of scientific studies that code rules.

3. **Version 3:** Refined through the codification of four written regulations from common-pool resource systems.

4. **Version 4:** Finalized with a mutual exclusivity check to ensure each rule fits into only one subtype.
