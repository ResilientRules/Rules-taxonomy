The **Rules Taxonomy** provides a detailed classification of the seven types of rules proposed by Ostrom and Crawford (2005), breaking them down into specific subtypes.

The taxonomy was developed in four stages:

1. **Version 1:** Based on the original definitions of rule types.

2. **Version 2:** Informed by a systematic review of scientific studies that code rules.

3. **Version 3:** Refined through the codification of four written regulations from common-pool resource systems.

4. **Version 4:** Finalized with a mutual exclusivity check to ensure each rule fits into only one subtype.

The file * *2 RULES TAXONOMY V4.0.md* * presents Version 4 of the taxonomy, including the name, acronymn, hierarchy, and description  of each subtype. The folder * *OLD VERSIONS* * contains the same information for previous versions. 

The * *OLD VERSIONS* * folder also includes a description of the changes made from Version 3 to Version 4 of the taxonomy.
