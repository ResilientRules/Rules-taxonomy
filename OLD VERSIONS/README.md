Previous versions of the **Rules Taxonomy** prior to [Version 4](https://github.com/ResilientRules/Rules-taxonomy/blob/main/2%20RULES%20TAXONOMY%20V4.0.md) are included here:

1. [**Version 1:**](https://ilaredavid.github.io/Test/V1/IAD_taxonomy_V1_2.html) Based on the original definitions of rule types.

2. [**Version 2:**](https://ilaredavid.github.io/Test/V2/IAD_taxonomy_V2_2.html) Informed by a systematic review of scientific studies that code rules.

3. [**Version 3:**](https://ilaredavid.github.io/Test/V3/IAD_taxonomy_V3_2.html) Refined through the codification of four written regulations from common-pool resource systems.

Each folder contains a table listing the name, acronym, hierarchy, and description of each subtype for the corresponding version, as well as the researchers who contributed to its development.

The file *V3 to V4* in *VERSION 3* folder lists the changes made from Version 3 to Version 4 of the taxonomy.
