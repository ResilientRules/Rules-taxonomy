# 4 CHOICE RULES
| QUESTION | ANSWER |
|----------|--------|
|Q.4.1. What is the difference between the contribution and allocation subtypes of CHOICE rules?|A.4.1. CHOICE.contribution refers to the contributions that members of a group or community are required to make, whether economic (such as fees), material (such as tools or inputs), or activity-based (such as time, labor, or collective work). These contributions support the creation, maintenance, or repair of shared resources or infrastructures. In contrast, CHOICE.allocation refers to how collective resources (of any kind) are distributed among members or used (e.g., hiring a person to perform a specific task using community funds, or paying for a particular service with community funds, would be considered as a CHOICE.allocation rule). |
|Q.4.2. How should rules be coded when they specify what people can do with a resource, such as land?|A.4.2. Rules that specify what someone can or cannot do with a particular resource (for example, land) should be coded as choice-action rules (CHOICE.action). These rules cover actions such as selling, leasing, expropriating, donating, or transferring the resource. For instance: “Members may lease their land to third parties” is an action rule, because it regulates what can be done with a resource. These rules do not define who can enter or leave the community. They apply to people who are already part of the system and regulate what they may or may not do. Even if the resource in question is also linked to membership eligibility, this type of rule is not a boundary rule, but a choice-action rule.|
|Q.4.3. How can we clearly distinguish between SCOPE rules and CHOICE rules when both seem to refer to activities or resources?|A.4.3. The key distinction lies in what the rule is doing, not in the words it uses. SCOPE rules are constitutive. They define the boundaries, goals, or domain of the institutional system. They specify what the system is about, where it applies, to which activities or resources, or what it aims to achieve. In contrast, CHOICE rules are regulatory. They specify what actors must, may, or must not do within that system. Tips for distinguish between CHOICE and SCOPE rules: (1) Code as SCOPE only when the statement defines the domain, goal, or boundaries of the system, without prescribing or restricting concrete actions by actors. (2) If the statement regulates behavior, even implicitly (e.g. allowing, requiring, or prohibiting actions on a resource or activity), code it as CHOICE, possibly with the relevant object (resource, activity, infrastructure). (3) Statements that could be rewritten as “X must/may/must not do Y” should not be coded as SCOPE. (4) SCOPE rules answer “what is governed and why”; CHOICE rules answer “what is done and how”. (5)	When in doubt, prioritize CHOICE and use SCOPE only for genuinely constitutive definitions.|
|Q.4.4. How should monitoring-related statements be coded, and why is monitoring treated as a CHOICE rule?|A.4.4. In the taxonomy of rules, monitoring is treated as a CHOICE rule by design. This reflects an explicit coding decision. Monitoring is coded as CHOICE.monitoring when a rule regulates the act of monitoring itself (i.e. that monitoring must occur, who performs it, or what is monitored). Other institutional analysis traditions may conceptualize monitoring as the stage where information and sanctions are activated; the taxonomy of rules does not deny this interpretation, but makes the design choice explicit. In practice, the coding of monitoring-related institutional statements depends on the specific content regulated by the statement. Monitoring provisions often include elements that belong to different rule types, and the appropriate coding should follow what the statement explicitly regulates: (1)	POSITION.function linked to CHOICE.monitoring. When the rule defines monitoring as a general responsibility of a role, it should be coded as POSITION.function linked to CHOICE.monitoring. Example: “The watchmen are responsible for monitoring the condition of the irrigation infrastructures and detecting incidents in Section B of the main canal”. (2)	CHOICE.monitoring linked to SCOPE. When the rule regulates the act of monitoring but specifies what is monitored (resource, infrastructure, etc.), monitoring is coded as CHOICE.monitoring and linked to the relevant SCOPE subtype. In this example, SCOPE.domain.resource): “The watchman must monitor the state of the water resource on a monthly basis using readings from the water meters”. (3) INFORMATION rules activated by monitoring. When the rule specifies that detecting an incident triggers an obligation to communicate information, the communication itself should be coded as an INFORMATION rule, linked to monitoring. Example: “If any malfunction or unauthorized discharge is detected, the watchman must report the incident to the Governing Board in writing.” This should be coded as INFORMATION.network.node; INFORMATION.network.subject; INFORMATION.setting.format linked to CHOICE.monitoring. (4)	PAYOFF rules activated by monitoring. When the rule specifies consequences that follow from detecting a violation, these should be coded as PAYOFF rules, linked to monitoring. Example: “If the watchman detects that a user irrigates outside their assigned time slot, the watchman must issue a warning to the infringing user.” This should be coded as PAYOFF.cause.action; PAYOFF.consequence.warning linked to CHOICE.monitoring.|
