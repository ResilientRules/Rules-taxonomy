# 3 QUESTIONS ABOUT BOUNDARY RULES
| QUESTION | ANSWER |
|----------|--------|
|Q.3.1. How should the processes and the control of entering or exiting a position be coded, and how do they differ?|A.3.1. The distinction lies in what the institutional statement (IS) is specifying. An IS should be coded as BOUNDARY.entry.procedure or BOUNDARY.exit.procedure when it describes the steps or procedures that must be followed to enter or exit a position. For example: filling out a form, paying a fee, or completing a training. These steps may also involve other types of rules. For instance, if a candidate must submit certain documents, that part may be coded as an INFORMATION rule (INFORMATION.network.node; INFORMATION.network.subject INFORMATION.setting.channel), and linked to the entry process. On the other hand, BOUNDARY.entry.control or BOUNDARY.exit.control should be used when the IS defines whether access to or exit from a position is free or controlled, for example, if it must be approved, authorized, or decided by a third party. These control rules are often linked to an AGGREGATION rule (subtype node), since the control usually depends on a decision-making process. For example: “Candidates for the predoctoral position will be selected through a merit-based process, to be decided by an external committee” would be coded as BOUNDARY.entry.control linked with AGGREGATION.node. Understanding this distinction helps identify when a rule is about permission or restriction (control) versus when it is about procedure or implementation (process).|
|Q.3.2. How should a rule be coded when land ownership is a condition for entering a community or association?|A.3.2. When a rule establishes that a person must own or have access to land in order to become part of a community or association, it should be coded as a boundary rule, specifically as eligibility based on resources (BOUNDARY.eligibility.resource). For example: “Only individuals who own land within the territory may join the irrigation association.” This rule is about who can enter the system and under what condition. It does not matter whether the land is acquired through purchase, inheritance, lease, or donation. The key point here is that having land is a requirement. Rules that define what people can do with that land (such as selling, donating, or leasing it) are not boundary rules, but action rules, and should be coded separately under choice-action rules. These are addressed in the choice section of this FAQ.|
|Q.3.3. How should it be coded when occupying a position is mandatory or cannot be declined?|A.3.3. The key is to look at whether the rule is defining the general attributes of a role (POSITION.definition) or regulating the action of exiting a role (BOUNDARY.exit). When the rule regulates that a person must accept the position or cannot leave it once appointed, it should be coded as a boundary rule, specifically BOUNDARY.exit, since it restricts the exit from the position. If the rule describes the role itself, for example, stating that the position is mandatory, this is a constitutive rule that characterizes the position and should be coded as POSITION.definition, with a link to BOUNDARY.exit if it refers to the inability to leave the role.|
|Q.3.4. How should rules about the rotation of a position be coded?|A.3.4. Rules that establish that a position must rotate after a certain period or under specific conditions should be coded as BOUNDARY.entry.succession. These rules define how a position is passed from one person to another, either temporarily or permanently. For example: “The coordination role rotates every year among the active members of the working group.” This is not a rule about who is eligible or what the position does, but about how it is successively filled. Rotation is considered a form of succession, and can occur by design or in response to events like illness.|
|Q.3.5. How should it be coded when candidates are presented to enter a position?|A.3.5. If the rule describes how someone is selected for a position from among those who are already eligible, it should be coded as BOUNDARY.entry.control. These rules define how access to a position is decided. For example:
“To become a watchman, eligible individuals must be selected through a vote conducted by the community when multiple candidates are available.” This would be coded as BOUNDARY.entry.control linked to AGGREGATION.procedure.form, since it refers to the control of entry and also indicates the form in which the decision is made (through vote).|
