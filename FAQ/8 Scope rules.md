# 8. QUESTIONS ABOUT SCOPE RULES
| QUESTION | ANSWER |
|----------|--------|
|Q.8.1. When a IS refers to an activity, how do we know if it should be coded as SCOPE rule or as another type of rule?|A.8.1. Some rules define which activities are managed or regulated by a community or association, such as fishing, livestock raising, or timber harvesting. These are constitutive rules and should be coded as SCOPE.domain.activity, because they describe the domain of activity covered by the regulation. For example: “The community shall manage only livestock and timber harvesting activities.” This is different from CHOICE rules, which regulate specific actions. If a rule says what someone must, may, or may not do, it is not defining the scope of the system but regulating behavior, and should be coded as a regulatory rule, most likely a CHOICE rule, unless the action refers to decision-making (AGGREGATION), information exchange (INFORMATION), or another type.|
|Q.8.2. What is the difference between a rule that defines spatial scope and a rule that defines allocation?|A.8.2. Rules that define the geographic area to which a regulation applies, or that describe the spatial boundaries of a community or system, should be coded as SCOPE.domain.spatial rules. For example: “The forest known as Fangorn is part of the territory managed by the community”. These are constitutive rules that establish the extent or limits of the space under governance. These statements do not regulate behavior or describe how resources are used. By contrast, rules that describe how a resource is distributed, shared, or assigned among members should be coded as CHOICE.allocation rules. These are regulatory rules that define how benefits, goods, or services are allocated. For example: “Each registered member receives a monthly share of firewood from the communal storage.” This rule explains how a shared resource is divided among members, and it should be coded as CHOICE.allocation.type.material rule.|
