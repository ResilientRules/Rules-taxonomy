# 7 QUESTIONS ABOUT POSITION RULES
| QUESTION | ANSWER |
|----------|--------|
|Q.7.1. How can we distinguish between rules that define the function of a position and those that regulate what someone in that position must do?|A.7.1. POSITION.function refers to rules that define the general functions, rights, or duties associated with a position. These are usually constitutive rules that describe what a role is responsible for, using verbs like “is in charge of” or “is responsible for.” However, many regulatory rules, especially choice, aggregation or information rules, also refer to people in positions who have to do something. This can lead to confusion. For example, the rule “The Secretary must send a letter to the administration to report the decisions made at the meeting” should be coded as an INFORMATION rule, not POSITION.function, because it regulates a specific action (sending a letter), not the general function of the Secretary. POSITION.function is used when the rule is defining overarching responsibilities or rights. It’s common to find formal regulations (written rules) where an article lists several duties or rights of a position. If each item in the list is a full statement with its own verb that clearly points to a different rule type, such as CHOICE (e.g., the obligation to participate in assemblies) or INFORMATION (e.g., the obligation to provide certain information), each item should be coded based on its own rule type. However, they may all be linked to POSITION.function if the overarching purpose of the article is to define the role’s functions.  |
|Q.7.2. How should it be coded when a rule mentions that someone has a “voice and vote”?|A.7.2. It depends on how the rule is formulated and what it regulates. If the statement defines a general right associated with a position, for example: “All active members have voice and vote”, it is a constitutive rule, and should be coded as a POSITION.function, since it describes the rights or functions tied to a role. However, if the rule defines who participates in a specific decision-making process, especially under certain conditions (such as attending a meeting), it is a regulatory rule, and should be coded as AGGREGATION.node (who is involved in the decision) and possibly AGGREGATION.procedure.condition (if there is a condition to participate). For example: “Those who do not attend the assembly have neither voice nor vote in it” is not defining a general role, but rather restricting participation in a specific decision.|
