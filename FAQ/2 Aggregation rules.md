# 2 QUESTIONS ABOUT AGGREGATION RULES
| QUESTION | ANSWER |
|----------|--------|
|Q.2.1. Should the rule subtype “AGGREGATION.node” always be used when a decision is mentioned in an IS?|A.2.1. Not necessarily. If the main verb in the institutional statement refers to the act of deciding, and the statement defines what a specific position or entity must decide, then it should be coded as AGGREGATION.node. For example: “The Governing Board shall decide the annual membership fee during the ordinary annual assembly.” This would be coded as AGGREGATION.node, linked to CHOICE.contribution.type.economic and CHOICE.meeting.type. However, if the decision is only mentioned as a condition for another action (not as the core verb), we code based on the main verb and link to AGGREGATION.node. For instance: “Members may borrow books from the community library during office hours, with prior authorization from the librarian.” Here, the statement is about what members may do, so the rule type is CHOICE with subtype action, linked to an AGGREGATION type with subtype node to reflect that the action depends on a prior decision.|
|Q.2.2. How should rules related to conflict resolution be coded?|A.2.2. Rules that define how conflicts are resolved are usually coded as AGGREGATION.conflict, especially when the rule specifies who is responsible for making the decision or intervening. For example: “In case of conflict between users, the president may intervene to mediate the disagreement” would be coded as AGG.conflict, since it defines who manages the resolution. However, not all conflict-related rules fall under this category. Some rules describe actions that support or precede conflict resolution, such as submitting a complaint or informing a governing body, and these may belong to other types and subtypes of rules. For instance: “In case of conflict, affected users must submit a letter to the governing board explaining the situation” would be coded as an information rule (INFORMATION.network.node; INF.network.subject; INF.setting.channel), linked to AGGREGATION.conflict, since the action supports a decision-making process but is not the decision itself. The key is to focus on what the rule actually regulates.|
