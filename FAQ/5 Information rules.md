# 5 QUESTIONS ABOUT INFORMATION RULES
| QUESTION | ANSWER |
|----------|--------|
|Q.5.1. How should IS about submitting requests, applications, or claims be coded?|A.5.1. Rules that refer to submitting an authorization, a request, or a claim should be coded as INFORMATION rules, since they involve the transmission or exchange of information (network.node, network.subject), usually through a specified channel (setting.channel) or with a specific format (setting.format). It’s important not to infer elements that are not explicitly stated. For instance, if a IS says that the request must be submitted via letter, we code the subject and the channel, but not the format. These information rules may also be connected to other rule types depending on their purpose. For example, if the submission refers to applying for a position, it could be connected to a boundary rule (BOUNDARY.entry.procedure). If it involves appealing a decision, it might connect to an aggregation procedure, such as AGGREGATION.procedure.lack. The core idea is that the act of submitting is part of an information process, and the coding should reflect what is actually stated in the IS.|
|Q.5.2. How should references to censuses, registries, records, archives, or specific documents be coded?|A.5.2. References to censuses, registries, maps, inventories, or any type of record in a specific document are typically part of information rules, as they involve the organization, transmission, or storage of information. When the rule refers to the use or transmission of such documents, it should be coded as INFORMATION.setting.channel, since it specifies the medium or mechanism through which information flows. For example: “The secretary must send the updated census to the Regional Registry within 10 days after its review.” This is an information rule with the following subtypes: INFORMATION.network.node (who sends and who receives), INFORMATION.setting.channel (the registry), and INFORMATION.setting.time.timing (the time for sending it). |
|Q.5.3. How should opening a sanction file be coded?|A.5.3. When a rule refers to the opening of a sanction file, it should be coded as an INFORMATION rule. This type of rule usually describes how a communication must be made, for example, through a written letter or form, and what that communication is about. In this case, the subject is the initiation of a sanction process. These elements correspond to the INFORMATION. setting.channel and INFORMATION.network.subject subtypes. Opening a sanction file is not just an administrative step. It is usually the beginning of a process that may lead to a warning or a formal sanction. Because of that, this INFORMATION rule is linked to a PAYOFF rule. Depending on the case, it may be associated with a PAYOFF.consequence.warning or a PAYOFF.consequence.sanction.|
|Q.5.4. How should it be coded when, in response to a rule violation, a report, complaint, or denunciation occurs?|A.5.4. Rules that require or allow someone to report, denounce, or file a complaint in response to a violation should be coded as information rules. These rules describe the communication of information, often indicating who communicates what to whom. In those cases, the relevant subtypes are INFORMATION.network.subject and, if applicable, INFORMATION.network.node. This is not a sanction in itself. It is a rule about informing someone when a violation is detected. For that reason, it should not be coded as a PAYOFF rule. If the rule does not describe any direct consequence following the report, it remains an information rule. However, in many cases, this type of rule is linked to a choice rule related to monitoring, because it reflects a mechanism to detect or control behavior. In those cases, it can be associated with a CHOICE.monitoring rule, for example: “Any member who observes a violation of the regulations must report it to the board of directors.” |
|Q.5.5. Is preparing and creating documents like censuses, reports, or minutes considered an action, a function, or an information rule?|A.5.5. In most cases, preparing or drafting documents such as censuses, reports, or meeting minutes is considered an INFORMATION rule. These rules describe the generation and flow of information within the system. If the rule specifies what kind of document must be created, who must create it, and how or in what format, it should be coded using information rule subtypes. That includes who is involved in the communication (INFORMATION.network.node), the content (INFORMATION.network.subject), the format (INFORMATION.setting.format), or the channel (INFORMATION.setting.channel). For example: “The secretary must prepare a written report of the meeting and submit it to the board.” However, if the rule states that preparing a certain document is part of what a position is responsible for, then it defines a general function. In that case, it should be coded as a POSITION.function linked to an information rule, for example: “The secretary is responsible for drafting the meeting minutes.”|
