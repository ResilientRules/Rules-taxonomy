# 3. QUESTIONS ABOUT BOUNDARY RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |

|Q.3.1. How should the processes and the control of entering or exiting a position be coded, and how do they differ?|All types|The distinction lies in what the institutional statement (IS) is specifying. An IS should be coded as BOUNDARY.entry.procedure or BOUNDARY.exit.procedure when it describes the steps or procedures that must be followed to enter or exit a position. For example: filling out a form, paying a fee, or completing a training. These steps may also involve other types of rules. For instance, if a candidate must submit certain documents, that part may be coded as an INFORMATION rule (INFORMATION.network.node; INFORMATION.network.subject INFORMATION.setting.channel), and linked to the entry process. On the other hand, BOUNDARY.entry.control or BOUNDARY.exit.control should be used when the IS defines whether access to or exit from a position is free or controlled, for example, if it must be approved, authorized, or decided by a third party. These control rules are often linked to an AGGREGATION rule (subtype node), since the control usually depends on a decision-making process. For example: “Candidates for the predoctoral position will be selected through a merit-based process, to be decided by an external committee” would be coded as BOUNDARY.entry.control linked with AGGREGATION.node. Understanding this distinction helps identify when a rule is about permission or restriction (control) versus when it is about procedure or implementation (process).|
