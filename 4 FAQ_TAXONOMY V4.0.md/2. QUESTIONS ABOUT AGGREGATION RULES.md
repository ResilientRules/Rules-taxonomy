# 2. QUESTIONS ABOUT AGGREGATION RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|----------|-----------|--------|
|Q.2.1. Should the rule subtype “AGGREGATION.node” always be used when a decision is mentioned in an IS?|All types|Not necessarily. If the main verb in the institutional statement refers to the act of deciding, and the statement defines what a specific position or entity must decide, then it should be coded as AGGREGATION.node. For example: “The Governing Board shall decide the annual membership fee during the ordinary annual assembly.” This would be coded as AGGREGATION.node, linked to CHOICE.contribution.type.economic and CHOICE.meeting.type. However, if the decision is only mentioned as a condition for another action (not as the core verb), we code based on the main verb and link to AGGREGATION.node. For instance: “Members may borrow books from the community library during office hours, with prior authorization from the librarian.” Here, the statement is about what members may do, so the rule type is CHOICE with subtype action, linked to an AGGREGATION type with subtype node to reflect that the action depends on a prior decision.|
