|Q.5.1. How should IS about submitting requests, applications, or claims be coded?|All types|Rules that refer to submitting an authorization, a request, or a claim should be coded as INFORMATION rules, since they involve the transmission or exchange of information (network.node, network.subject), usually through a specified channel (setting.channel) or with a specific format (setting.format). Itâ€™s important not to infer elements that are not explicitly stated. For instance, if a IS says that the request must be submitted via letter, we code the subject and the channel, but not the format. These information rules may also be connected to other rule types depending on their purpose. For example, if the submission refers to applying for a position, it could be connected to a boundary rule (BOUNDARY.entry.procedure). If it involves appealing a decision, it might connect to an aggregation procedure, such as AGGREGATION.procedure.lack. The core idea is that the act of submitting is part of an information process, and the coding should reflect what is actually stated in the IS.|
