# 8. QUESTIONS ABOUT SCOPE RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|----------|-----------|--------|
|Q.8.1. When a IS refers to an activity, how do we know if it should be coded as SCOPE rule or as another type of rule?|All types|Some rules define which activities are managed or regulated by a community or association, such as fishing, livestock raising, or timber harvesting. These are constitutive rules and should be coded as SCOPE.domain.activity, because they describe the domain of activity covered by the regulation. For example: “The community shall manage only livestock and timber harvesting activities.” This is different from CHOICE rules, which regulate specific actions. If a rule says what someone must, may, or may not do, it is not defining the scope of the system but regulating behavior, and should be coded as a regulatory rule, most likely a CHOICE rule, unless the action refers to decision-making (AGGREGATION), information exchange (INFORMATION), or another type.|
