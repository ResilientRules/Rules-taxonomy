# 6. PAYOFF RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|----------|-----------|--------|
|Q.6.1. What are payoff rules, and how can we distinguish them from contribution and allocation subtypes of rules?|All types|Payoff rules define the consequences of specific actions or outcomes. These consequences may be sanctions (PAYOFF.consequence.sanction), rewards (PAYOFF.consequence.reward), or warnings (PAYOFF.consequence.warning), and they stem from either a specific action (PAYOFF.cause.action), such as walking a dog without a leash in a park, or an outcome (PAYOFF.cause.outcome), such as failing to meet reforestation targets in an environmental program. Payoffs can be classified by type: economic (e.g., paying a fine, PAYOFF.type.economic), material (e.g., loss of access to water, PAYOFF.type.material), positional (e.g., expulsion from a group, PAYOFF.type.positon), among others. Although payoffs involve the idea of giving or receiving something, they must be clearly distinguished from contributions (CHOICE.contribution), which refer to what members give to the collective (e.g., membership fees or labor), and allocations (CHOICE.allocation), which refer to the distribution of collective resources or benefits. Payoffs are about consequences, not regular flows. Some cases can be confusing. For instance, if a community rule defines how the salary of an employee is set (e.g., a minimum or maximum) and specifies that the payment comes from community funds, this is about allocation (CHOICE.allocation.criteria; CHOICE.allocation.type.economic). In contrast, if a rule states that the community receives a subsidy for meeting conservation goals, thatâ€™s an incentive, and should be coded as PAYOFF.consequence.reward. Similarly, if a position includes a small economic incentive as a feature of the role, it also qualifies as a reward (PAYOFF.consequence.reward). In all cases, it is essential to read carefully and identify whether the rule is defining a requirement, a distribution, or a consequence.|
