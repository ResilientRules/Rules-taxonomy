# 1 IDENTIFYING IS, TYPE AND SUBTYPE OF RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|----------|-----------|--------|
|Q.1.1. How do we define an institutional statement (IS)?|All types |A.1.1. An institutional statement (IS) is any statement that includes information about a rule. These rules can be regulatory, when they indicate what is required, permitted, or prohibited (i.e., what must/must not or may/may not be done), or constitutive, when they define elements of the system, such as who holds which positions, what the goals are, or what domain a regulation applies to (spatial, legal, temporal, etc.). Regulatory rules often follow a structure like "X must do Y", while constitutive rules look more like "X is Y". In both cases, the central element is the verb, either an aim (for regulatory rules) or a function (for constitutive rules), since it indicates the type of rule and guides its classification within the taxonomy. While it’s not necessary to apply the full institutional grammar (IG) framework to identify an IS, knowing its basic structure can help. In particular, it’s useful to pay attention to who is acting (the attribute in regulatory rules) or what is being defined or characterized (the entity in constitutive rules), what they’re doing (the aim in regulatory rules) or what function is being defined or characterized (in constitutive rules), and under what conditions (the context in which the rule applies, when it is activated, or what constraints exist).|
|Q.1.2. What if a statement includes multiple verbs or actions?|All types|A.1.2. When coding rules types and subtypes, we focus on the core verbs, those that express required, permitted, or prohibited actions, or define or characterize institutional functions. Not every verb or verbal form in a sentence is relevant; what matters are the verbs that carry regulatory or constitutive weight. If a statement includes more than one of these core verbs, it should be split into separate institutional statements (IS), one for each aim or function identified. Each of these may correspond to a different rule type or subtype.|
|Q.1.3. To what level of detail should an IS be coded?|All types|A.1.3. The level of detail used when coding an institutional statement depends on the research question and the goal of the analysis. Coding down to the most specific tier is useful to capture nuanced differences across cases, whereas coding at a more general level may be sufficient and more practical in other contexts. Coding at a more general level is faster to implement and more robust for general analyses, but it may obscure subtle differences. Conversely, coding with finer subtypes requires greater effort but provides richer and more precise codifications, particularly for capturing variation within broader categories. Importantly, the level of specificity in coding must be applied consistently and be well aligned with the purpose of the study.|
|Q.1.4. How to choose the rule type when in doubt between two options in an IS?|All types|A.1.4. To identify the rule type in an institutional statement (IS), the key is to look closely at the core verb (the aim or function). If the verb refers to entering or exiting a position, it's likely a BOUNDARY rule. If it involves giving, receiving, or transmitting information, it points to an INFORMATION rule. If it’s about making individual or collective decisions, it suggests an AGGREGATION rule. If it refers to applying rewards or sanctions, it indicates a PAYOFF rule. These distinctions matter, because many of these verbs describe actions, but not all action-related verbs correspond to CHOICE rules. On the other hand, if the verb defines a position or its general function (e.g., roles, rights, duties), it should be coded as a POSITION rule. And if the verb sets goals, objectives, or defines the domain of application (spatial, temporal, legal, cultural), then it's a SCOPE rule.|
|Q.1.5. OK, I can identify the main rule type in the IS, but what if there seems to be information related to another rule type in the same IS?|All types|A.1.5. Even when the main rule type in an institutional statement (IS) is clear, based on the core verb, the statement may also contain information related to other rule types. In those cases, we can code those additional elements as subtypes connected (or linked) to the main rule type. For example: “The President must communicate in writing the amount of the annual membership fee to all members of the association.” The core verb here is “communicate”, so this is clearly an INFORMATION rule. It can be coded with the rule subtypes: INFORMATION.network.node (who is involved in the communication), INFORMATION.network.subject (what content is being shared), and INFORMATION.setting.format (in what format the communication takes place). However, the content of the information (the annual fee) refers to a choice rule about economic contributions. Thus, this rule can be coded as an information rule linked to a CHOICE rule, and specifically with the subtype CHOICE.contribution.type.economic.|
|Q.1.6. Can IS be coded with multiple subtypes of the same rule type?|All types|A.1.6. Yes, an institutional statement (IS) can be coded with more than one subtype, as long as all codes fall under the same rule type. This is relatively common. For instance, in INFORMATION rules, a single statement may specify who communicates, what is communicated, how, and in what format. For example: “The President must communicate in writing by letter the amount of the annual membership fee to all members of the association.” This would be coded as INFORMATION.network.node (who communicates), INFORMATION.network.subject (what is communicated), INFORMATION.setting.format (format), and INFORMATION.setting.channel (channel), connected to a choice rule about economic contributions: CHOICE.contribution.type.economic. PAYOFF rules are another frequent case. A single IS may describe the cause of a payoff (an action or an outcome), the type of consequence (sanction or reward), and the nature of the consequence (economic, material, positional, etc.). For example: “A member must not collect forest products out of season; if they do, they must pay a fine.” This statement includes multiple payoff subtypes: PAYOFF.cause.action (the prohibited action), PAYOFF.consequence.sanction (the consequence, which is a sanction), and PAYOFF.type.economic (the type of sanction, which is economic).|
