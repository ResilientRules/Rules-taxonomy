# 1. QUESTIONS ABOUT IDENTIFYING IS, TYPE AND TAXONOMY OF RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|Q.1.1. How do we define an institutional statement (IS)?|All types |A.1.1. An institutional statement (IS) is any statement that includes information about a rule. These rules can be regulatory, when they indicate what is required, permitted, or prohibited (i.e., what must/must not or may/may not be done), or constitutive, when they define elements of the system, such as who holds which positions, what the goals are, or what domain a regulation applies to (spatial, legal, temporal, etc.). Regulatory rules often follow a structure like "X must do Y", while constitutive rules look more like "X is Y". In both cases, the central element is the verb, either an aim (for regulatory rules) or a function (for constitutive rules), since it indicates the type of rule and guides its classification within the taxonomy. While it’s not necessary to apply the full institutional grammar (IG) framework to identify an IS, knowing its basic structure can help. In particular, it’s useful to pay attention to who is acting (the attribute in regulatory rules) or what is being defined or characterized (the entity in constitutive rules), what they’re doing (the aim in regulatory rules) or what function is being defined or characterized (in constitutive rules), and under what conditions (the context in which the rule applies, when it is activated, or what constraints exist).|
|Q.1.2. What if a statement includes multiple verbs or actions?|All types|A.1.2. When coding rules types and subtypes, we focus on the core verbs, those that express required, permitted, or prohibited actions, or define or characterize institutional functions. Not every verb or verbal form in a sentence is relevant; what matters are the verbs that carry regulatory or constitutive weight. If a statement includes more than one of these core verbs, it should be split into separate institutional statements (IS), one for each aim or function identified. Each of these may correspond to a different rule type or subtype.|
|Q.1.3. To what level of detail should an IS be coded?|All types|A.1.3. The level of detail used when coding an institutional statement depends on the research question and the goal of the analysis. Coding down to the most specific tier is useful to capture nuanced differences across cases, whereas coding at a more general level may be sufficient and more practical in other contexts. Coding at a more general level is faster to implement and more robust for general analyses, but it may obscure subtle differences. Conversely, coding with finer subtypes requires greater effort but provides richer and more precise codifications, particularly for capturing variation within broader categories. Importantly, the level of specificity in coding must be applied consistently and be well aligned with the purpose of the study.|
|Q.1.4. How to choose the rule type when in doubt between two options in an IS?|All types|A.1.4. To identify the rule type in an institutional statement (IS), the key is to look closely at the core verb (the aim or function). If the verb refers to entering or exiting a position, it's likely a BOUNDARY rule. If it involves giving, receiving, or transmitting information, it points to an INFORMATION rule. If it’s about making individual or collective decisions, it suggests an AGGREGATION rule. If it refers to applying rewards or sanctions, it indicates a PAYOFF rule. These distinctions matter, because many of these verbs describe actions, but not all action-related verbs correspond to CHOICE rules. On the other hand, if the verb defines a position or its general function (e.g., roles, rights, duties), it should be coded as a POSITION rule. And if the verb sets goals, objectives, or defines the domain of application (spatial, temporal, legal, cultural), then it's a SCOPE rule.|
|Q.1.5. OK, I can identify the main rule type in the IS, but what if there seems to be information related to another rule type in the same IS?|All types|A.1.5. Even when the main rule type in an institutional statement (IS) is clear, based on the core verb, the statement may also contain information related to other rule types. In those cases, we can code those additional elements as subtypes connected (or linked) to the main rule type. For example: “The President must communicate in writing the amount of the annual membership fee to all members of the association.” The core verb here is “communicate”, so this is clearly an INFORMATION rule. It can be coded with the rule subtypes: INFORMATION.network.node (who is involved in the communication), INFORMATION.network.subject (what content is being shared), and INFORMATION.setting.format (in what format the communication takes place). However, the content of the information (the annual fee) refers to a choice rule about economic contributions. Thus, this rule can be coded as an information rule linked to a CHOICE rule, and specifically with the subtype CHOICE.contribution.type.economic.|
|Q.1.6. Can IS be coded with multiple subtypes of the same rule type?|All types|A.1.6. Yes, an institutional statement (IS) can be coded with more than one subtype, as long as all codes fall under the same rule type. This is relatively common. For instance, in INFORMATION rules, a single statement may specify who communicates, what is communicated, how, and in what format. For example: “The President must communicate in writing by letter the amount of the annual membership fee to all members of the association.” This would be coded as INFORMATION.network.node (who communicates), INFORMATION.network.subject (what is communicated), INFORMATION.setting.format (format), and INFORMATION.setting.channel (channel), connected to a choice rule about economic contributions: CHOICE.contribution.type.economic. PAYOFF rules are another frequent case. A single IS may describe the cause of a payoff (an action or an outcome), the type of consequence (sanction or reward), and the nature of the consequence (economic, material, positional, etc.). For example: “A member must not collect forest products out of season; if they do, they must pay a fine.” This statement includes multiple payoff subtypes: PAYOFF.cause.action (the prohibited action), PAYOFF.consequence.sanction (the consequence, which is a sanction), and PAYOFF.type.economic (the type of sanction, which is economic).|
# 2. QUESTIONS ABOUT AGGREGATION RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|Q.2.1. Should the rule subtype “AGGREGATION.node” always be used when a decision is mentioned in an IS?|All types|Not necessarily. If the main verb in the institutional statement refers to the act of deciding, and the statement defines what a specific position or entity must decide, then it should be coded as AGGREGATION.node. For example: “The Governing Board shall decide the annual membership fee during the ordinary annual assembly.” This would be coded as AGGREGATION.node, linked to CHOICE.contribution.type.economic and CHOICE.meeting.type. However, if the decision is only mentioned as a condition for another action (not as the core verb), we code based on the main verb and link to AGGREGATION.node. For instance: “Members may borrow books from the community library during office hours, with prior authorization from the librarian.” Here, the statement is about what members may do, so the rule type is CHOICE with subtype action, linked to an AGGREGATION type with subtype node to reflect that the action depends on a prior decision.|
# 3. QUESTIONS ABOUT BOUNDARY RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|Q.3.1. How should the processes and the control of entering or exiting a position be coded, and how do they differ?|All types|The distinction lies in what the institutional statement (IS) is specifying. An IS should be coded as BOUNDARY.entry.procedure or BOUNDARY.exit.procedure when it describes the steps or procedures that must be followed to enter or exit a position. For example: filling out a form, paying a fee, or completing a training. These steps may also involve other types of rules. For instance, if a candidate must submit certain documents, that part may be coded as an INFORMATION rule (INFORMATION.network.node; INFORMATION.network.subject INFORMATION.setting.channel), and linked to the entry process. On the other hand, BOUNDARY.entry.control or BOUNDARY.exit.control should be used when the IS defines whether access to or exit from a position is free or controlled, for example, if it must be approved, authorized, or decided by a third party. These control rules are often linked to an AGGREGATION rule (subtype node), since the control usually depends on a decision-making process. For example: “Candidates for the predoctoral position will be selected through a merit-based process, to be decided by an external committee” would be coded as BOUNDARY.entry.control linked with AGGREGATION.node. Understanding this distinction helps identify when a rule is about permission or restriction (control) versus when it is about procedure or implementation (process).|
# 4. QUESTIONS ABOUT CHOICE RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|Q.4.1. What is the difference between the contribution and allocation subtypes of CHOICE rules?|All types|CHOICE.contribution refers to the contributions that members of a group or community are required to make, whether economic (such as fees), material (such as tools or inputs), or activity-based (such as time, labor, or collective work). These contributions support the creation, maintenance, or repair of shared resources or infrastructures. In contrast, CHOICE.allocation refers to how collective resources (of any kind) are distributed among members or used (e.g., hiring a person to perform a specific task using community funds, or paying for a particular service with community funds, would be considered as a CHOICE.allocation rule).|
# 5. QUESTIONS ABOUT INFORMATION RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|Q.5.1. How should IS about submitting requests, applications, or claims be coded?|All types|Rules that refer to submitting an authorization, a request, or a claim should be coded as INFORMATION rules, since they involve the transmission or exchange of information (network.node, network.subject), usually through a specified channel (setting.channel) or with a specific format (setting.format). It’s important not to infer elements that are not explicitly stated. For instance, if a IS says that the request must be submitted via letter, we code the subject and the channel, but not the format. These information rules may also be connected to other rule types depending on their purpose. For example, if the submission refers to applying for a position, it could be connected to a boundary rule (BOUNDARY.entry.procedure). If it involves appealing a decision, it might connect to an aggregation procedure, such as AGGREGATION.procedure.lack. The core idea is that the act of submitting is part of an information process, and the coding should reflect what is actually stated in the IS.|
# 6. QUESTIONS ABOUT PAYOFF RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|Q.6.1. What are payoff rules, and how can we distinguish them from contribution and allocation subtypes of rules?|All types|Payoff rules define the consequences of specific actions or outcomes. These consequences may be sanctions (PAYOFF.consequence.sanction), rewards (PAYOFF.consequence.reward), or warnings (PAYOFF.consequence.warning), and they stem from either a specific action (PAYOFF.cause.action), such as walking a dog without a leash in a park, or an outcome (PAYOFF.cause.outcome), such as failing to meet reforestation targets in an environmental program. Payoffs can be classified by type: economic (e.g., paying a fine, PAYOFF.type.economic), material (e.g., loss of access to water, PAYOFF.type.material), positional (e.g., expulsion from a group, PAYOFF.type.positon), among others. Although payoffs involve the idea of giving or receiving something, they must be clearly distinguished from contributions (CHOICE.contribution), which refer to what members give to the collective (e.g., membership fees or labor), and allocations (CHOICE.allocation), which refer to the distribution of collective resources or benefits. Payoffs are about consequences, not regular flows. Some cases can be confusing. For instance, if a community rule defines how the salary of an employee is set (e.g., a minimum or maximum) and specifies that the payment comes from community funds, this is about allocation (CHOICE.allocation.criteria; CHOICE.allocation.type.economic). In contrast, if a rule states that the community receives a subsidy for meeting conservation goals, that’s an incentive, and should be coded as PAYOFF.consequence.reward. Similarly, if a position includes a small economic incentive as a feature of the role, it also qualifies as a reward (PAYOFF.consequence.reward). In all cases, it is essential to read carefully and identify whether the rule is defining a requirement, a distribution, or a consequence.|
# 7. QUESTIONS ABOUT POSITION RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|Q.7.1. How can we distinguish between rules that define the function of a position and those that regulate what someone in that position must do?|All types|POSITION.function refers to rules that define the general functions, rights, or duties associated with a position. These are usually constitutive rules that describe what a role is responsible for, using verbs like “is in charge of” or “is responsible for.” However, many regulatory rules, especially choice, aggregation or information rules, also refer to people in positions who have to do something. This can lead to confusion. For example, the rule “The Secretary must send a letter to the administration to report the decisions made at the meeting” should be coded as an INFORMATION rule, not POSITION.function, because it regulates a specific action (sending a letter), not the general function of the Secretary. POSITION.function is used when the rule is defining overarching responsibilities or rights. It’s common to find formal regulations (written rules) where an article lists several duties or rights of a position. If each item in the list is a full statement with its own verb that clearly points to a different rule type —such as CHOICE (e.g., the obligation to participate in assemblies) or INFORMATION (e.g., the obligation to provide certain information)— each item should be coded based on its own rule type. However, they may all be linked to POSITION.function if the overarching purpose of the article is to define the role’s functions. |
# 8. QUESTIONS ABOUT SCOPE RULES
| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|Q.8.1. When a IS refers to an activity, how do we know if it should be coded as SCOPE rule or as another type of rule?|All types|Some rules define which activities are managed or regulated by a community or association, such as fishing, livestock raising, or timber harvesting. These are constitutive rules and should be coded as SCOPE.domain.activity, because they describe the domain of activity covered by the regulation. For example: “The community shall manage only livestock and timber harvesting activities.” This is different from CHOICE rules, which regulate specific actions. If a rule says what someone must, may, or may not do, it is not defining the scope of the system but regulating behavior, and should be coded as a regulatory rule, most likely a CHOICE rule, unless the action refers to decision-making (AGGREGATION), information exchange (INFORMATION), or another type.|
