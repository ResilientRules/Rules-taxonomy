| QUESTION | RULE TYPE | ANSWER |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Q.1.1. Up to which TIER should an IS be coded? | All types | All IS must be coded to the finest level of detail. |
| Q.1.2. How to choose IS TIER 1 when in doubt between two rule types? | All types | 1. An IS can only be coded with one TIER1 rule.<br>2. The following prioritization should be used when in doubt between two or more TIER1 rule types: <br>First: INF, PAY, BOU and POS.<br>Second: AGG.<br>Third: CHO and SCO.<br>3. When an institutional statement is related to more than one type of TIER1 rule, the one that best relates to the central idea of the IS should be selected. Links to the other relevant rule type(s) may be included, depending on the context and appropriateness. Prioritization helps, but exceptions may occur (see examples). |
| Q.1.3. How to differentiate a SCO rule from a CHO rule and how to differentiate these two from the other types of rules? | All types | The AIM component in scope rules describes an outcome rather than an action. If the AIM is directly tied to positions, boundaries, information, payoffs, or aggregation, it falls under those respective categories. Otherwise, if it's an outcome, it's a SCO rule; if it's an action, it's a CHO rule. Choice and Scope are "all other" categories. Also, if the AIM relates directly to entry/exit, information exchange, joint decisions, or payoffs, classify accordingly under BOU, INF, AGG, or PAY. (Ostrom, 2005). |
| Q.1.4. Can an IS be coded with two or more codes that differ in TIER2 to TIER6 levels? | All types | Yes. It’s common to assign more than one code within TIER2 to TIER6. For example, AGG_nod;AGG_ or INF_net;INF_sub;INF_cha. Example: “The CONAT gives local groups the list of newly certified producers.” → INF_net;INF_sub |
| How to codify segments related to historical events/events in the past? | All types | Not all past tense events are institutional statements. Assess whether they indicate the existence of past rules. Some may reflect activation conditions of past rules. |
| ¿Elaborar y crear documentos (censos, informes, actas, etc.) se considera una acción (CHO.act), una función (POS.fun) o una acción de información (INF)? | All types | Generally, creating or writing documents is considered an information process → INF. If defined explicitly as a function, it should be POS.fun with a LINK to INF. |
| Q.1.7 | All types | To code lists without a specific AIM, use the AIM of the first segment as reference. Label the first segment’s TYPE column as 'base'. |
| Q.1.8 | All types | If the list segments have their own AIM, the AIM in the first fragment is meaningless and should be labeled 'base' in the TYPE column. |
| Q.1.9 | All types | If multiple variants of a taxon appear in the same sentence with an AIM, count as one. If they are listed separately, code each one even if they are the same, as they are treated as independent entities with greater importance in statutes. |
